  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel, robust and high capacity watermarking method for 3D Meshes with arbitrary connectivities in spatial domain based on affine invariants. Given a 3D mesh model, a watermark is embedded as affine-invariant length ratios of one diagonal segment to the residing diagonal intersected by the other one in a coplanar convex quadrilateral. In the extraction process, a watermark is recovered by combining all the watermark pieces embedded in length ratios through 
majority voting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the robustness, high computational efficiency, high capacity, and affine-transformation-invariant characteristics of the proposed approach.}
