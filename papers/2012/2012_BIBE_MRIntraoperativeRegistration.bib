   abstract = {Co-registering pre- and intra- operative MR data is an important yet challenging problem due to different acqui- sition parameters, resolutions, and plane orientations. Despite its importance, previous approaches are often computationally intensive and thus cannot be employed in real-time. In this paper, a novel three-step approach is proposed to dynamically register pre-operative 4D MR data with intra-operative 2D RT-MRI to guide intracardiac procedures. Specifically, a novel preparatory step, executed in the pre-operative phase, is introduced to gener- ate bridging information that can be used to significantly speed up the on-the-fly registration in the intra-operative procedure. Our experimental results demonstrate an accuracy of 0.42mm and a processing speed of 26 FPS of the proposed approach on an off-the-shelf PC. This approach, was in particularly developed for performing intra-cardiac procedures with real-time MR guidance.}
